## Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning in Java: Medium Post
I believe AiML Oracle course is one of the best self learning courses for those who are new to Machine learning (ML), It does not go into detail about certain concepts which I think is good for beginners. However just like any self learning course it requires you to put effort into the content, and practice the coding problems yourself. In this Medium post I summarize the main topics, implement concepts in Java and provide the source code for the course project.

## Part 1 of the summary: [Intro to AI & ML](https://ninamaamary.medium.com/artificial-intelligence-with-machine-learning-in-java-intro-to-ai-ml-90dbb55b42cd)
### Part 1 table of content:
* Introduction to AI
* Data and Information
* Categorizing Data
* Why Now?
* Machine Learning Workflow

## Part 2 of the summary: [Trees and Recursion](https://ninamaamary.medium.com/artificial-intelligence-with-machine-learning-in-java-trees-and-recursion-a526a34a7282)
### Part 2 table of content: 
* Recursion
* Binary Trees
* Tree Traversal
* Yes/No Game
